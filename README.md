# C-programming-FESB
Library of all solved programs and tasks!

This is our library of all FESB related programs made in C.
The chosen ones, who see this, should feel free to contribute with their files!

While doing so, please keep the naming style similar and don't forget
to add a brief description of the task you solved.

Repository is split into weeks so we can sort programs based on when we 
did them on FESB.

Also, it would be cool if you added the text of the specific task at the bottom
of the .c file so we don't need to guess what was the point.

:)
